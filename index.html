                I try skimming through different lines of productivity. 
                By working on multiple platforms, not only do they keep me busy and my options open but 
                also help me understand multitudes of different skills.

                <li>Blogging as a way to get your content across to your audience as a visual text experiences</li>

              <p>
                Have you ever wondered about your aesthetic appeal?
                Aesthetic, from a Greek word meaning "perception," comes to us from German philosophers 
                who used it for a theory of the beautiful.

                <li>Aesthetics, nowadays can be associated with many terms.</li>
                <li>It can be related to your dressing style, your physical appearance.</li>
                <li>It is a form of expressing yourself to the world.</li>
                <li>Recognising your aesthetic is a long process being an ever-changing human being.</li>
                <li>I am extremely active on Pinterest, where I find my inspirations from.</li>

                Vlogging is a great way of expression and YouTube is the #1 search engine to put your work on. 
                It also helps me keep in check and be more productive throughout the week, trying to meet the deadlines.

			  <h3> Art </h3>
			   <p> I have always been into painting ever since I could remember. My biggest accomplishment yet in this 
           field was to have my art displayed in the New Jersey's Chilren's Museum at the age of 6. Post 10th, I haven't had the 
          time to be active as such, but there are new projects I am working on. </p>

			  <h3> Content Writing</h3>
			   <p> This is by far the most recent new skill I have tried breaking into. Reading has always been extremely calming, my main 
           genres being fiction and fantasy. Given the free time and ample clustered clouds of imagination, I have begun to write.

			  <h3> Basketball </h3>
			   <p> Since age 11, I recall, my passion for Basketball has been ever-growing. My most humbled experience has been of the few days I spent at national camp. 
          It taught me hard-work, perseverence and dedication. I also train kids sometimes!  </p>

              As philosphical as that may sound, it is true that if you never start somewhere, 
              you'll never be able to explore yourself there.
              I try to make myself as transparent in my hardwork as possible. If anything, I might fail,
